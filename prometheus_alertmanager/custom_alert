# clients are expected to continuously re-send alerts as long as they are still
# active (usually on the order of 30 seconds to 3 minutes).
#
# The labels are used to identify identical instances of an alert and
# to perform deduplication. The annotations are always set to those
# received most recently and are not identifying an alert.
#
# Both timestamps are optional. If startsAt is omitted, the current
# time is assigned by the Alertmanager. endsAt is only set if the end
# time of an alert is known. Otherwise it will be set to a configurable
# timeout period from the time since the alert was last received.
#
# The generatorURL field is a unique back-link which identifies the
# causing entity of this alert in the client.
